On opening the file in a browser you will see a right section and a left section.

Both the sections will have the same pattern of smiley face images except that on one side you will see an extra image
outside of the pattern. 

Your job is to identify that odd image and click on it to earn points. As you click the right image you will 
proceed to the next round which will be harder! 

Good luck :)
